#### Intro
This project is built with Jathp-Lisp running with P5, JS, HTML in a web browser page.
The robot will navigate through the maze using A* Search to find the best path until it
reaches its destination tile. The bot should uses the Manhattan (AKA Taxicab) metric as
the heuristic function H(N) which never overestimates the required number of bot
moves from a node, to the goal. Blue tiles are visited tiles and green circles are laid
out indicating the best path to the destination tile/goal.
